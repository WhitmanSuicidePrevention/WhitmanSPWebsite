## Pervasive Information Architecture

Posted on July 10, 2013

<br>

Part of starting a new job at a company who does not have a user experience group is learning to be proficient in all the areas that they need me to be a part of. A big issue that the company would like to focus on is information architecture, something that I understand, but don’t have much of a background in. That’s why I picked up the book Pervasive Information Architecture by Anndrea Resmini and Luca Rosati. I’ve only begun reading it, but it seems like a really interesting area of research.

<br>

So do you ever have to do information architecture in your job?

<br>

Do you have good books you enjoy in this area?

<br>

Are there areas that you were not knowledgable in that you had to learn for a job?

<br>

Let me know in the comments below.
