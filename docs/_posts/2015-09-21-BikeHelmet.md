## LED Bike Helmet

Posted on September 21, 2015

<br>

This summer, I was riding my bike everywhere. San Francisco is a difficult place to drive or park, so it made more sense to bike everywhere. At night that could be a very scary plan, as you’re riding in traffic and cars don’t pay much attention. So I came up with a good way to light up my helmet at night and keep myself safe.

I used an Adafruit Gemma, and two strips of neopixels. Little bit of solder and wiring along with code to make the red lights and I was up and running. It took a lot more trouble shooting than expected, I had one burned out pixel that made one of the strips not work at all, and a bad board to start with. In the end, I think it all turned out really well.
