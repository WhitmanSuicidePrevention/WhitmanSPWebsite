## Smart Home for Christmas

Posted on January 25, 2016

<br>

During winter break, I decided to relax with some soldering, once again. I find it strangely fun and relaxing. I used some networking cable for cleanliness and 6 temperature/humidity sensors all connected to an Arduino Uno Ether Net. This connects to the ethernet that runs throughout the house. The temp/humid sensors will run the length of our crawl space and report back to a main server. The server will let us know anytime that the temperature or humidity go outside of spec so that we are aware if there is a problem in the crawlspace. No one ever goes down there, so it would be nice to know if it were flooded before the boards rot. Next on the list is a push notification app for iOS to have the server notify our phones in the event of a problem.
