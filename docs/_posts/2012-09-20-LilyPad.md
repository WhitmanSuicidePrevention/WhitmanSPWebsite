## New toy! LilyPad Arduinos

Posted on September 20, 2012

<br>

So, I decided to try and put together a couple of things I really enjoy, playing with hardware and knitting. Yeah, you heard right, knitting. Looking around on the internet I come to find the LilyPad arduino out of MIT media labs. Oh MIT, you have all the fun toys. Mine just came in the mail today and I’m so excited about it! I’m not entirely sure what I will do with them, but I’m sure I will post about it in the future. Once I get a better understanding of the tech, I want to try and figure out how I can use this to help the smart home project!
