The winters in the North West are pretty dark and difficult for finding time to run when in the daylight. While I have a headlamp for when I need to see the blacktop in front of me, I decided I wanted a fun headband just to make myself visible on grey days. Days when itâ€™s not that itâ€™s pitch black outside, but just that itâ€™s so cloudy and overcast outside that I might be hard to see.

I used an AdaFruit Gemma micro controller sewed together with a parallel series of NeoPixels. I then gave it some code to make it rainbow through all the NeoPixel colors. Makes me so very easy to see! And stylish. ðŸ™‚
