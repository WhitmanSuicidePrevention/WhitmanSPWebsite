## Useful new tool: Rescue Time and Github Data Driven Documents

Posted on August 27, 2012

<br>

I’ve been working a while on several pages with visualizations of important quantitative data. I’ve been speaking a bit with a gentleman who works for Rescue Time (rescuetime.com), a fun new technology in time management. I’ve been using Rescue Time for a while to tell how I’m doing on productivity for the day and to try and boost it with their “Get Focused” feature that makes unproductive websites unavailable for a certain period of time. The graphics and visualizations are particularly wonderful.

<br>

To begin with it tries to assume what things are and are not productive for you, but you can change  websites or software to being a different level of productivity, and that changes the way that these graphs look and how it calculates your productivity.

<br>

And although some of my “not productive” time is productive because I’m chatting with other developers who are helping me out, I still think this is a great product with a ton of potential to help you out in knowing where your time is really spent.

<br>

At any rate, when I asked my Rescue Time contact how they came up with such wonderful visualizations, he pointed me toward and excellent tool. Data Driven Documents from GitHub (http://d3js.org/).

<br>

This resource is just, amazing. You can get the code for the graphs that they show, and they have all sorts of examples. I think this will really make my next dashboard a step above. And these guys have really done their research! When they talk about bullet charts, they even talk about Stephen Few, and how he created this type of chart.

<br>

And the best part is, it’s totally free! It’s an excellent resource that I will be using a lot of in the future. Thank you Rescue Time!

<br>

Do you know of any great resources out there for usability, user experience, or design? Let me know in the comments below and I will review them in future posts.
