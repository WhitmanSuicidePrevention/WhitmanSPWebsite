Another year, another WSU Hackathon. This year Crandall, Mackenzie, and myself built and coded some fun juggling toys.

<br>

There are arm wraps where the lights move faster and get brighter the faster that the person moves.

And there are juggling balls, that get brighter the higher they go and dimmer as they come back down and they also change color if theyâ€™re spun.

This year was so much fun, and we came away with 5th place!
