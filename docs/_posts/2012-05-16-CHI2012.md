## CHI 2012!

Posted on May 16, 2012

<br>

There’s just so much to be said about this conference, I don’t think it can be contained in a post.

So CHI2012 this year was pretty awesome. Held in Austin Texas, and even though the water made me sick for some reason, still a fun experience. Also, I didn’t take hardly enough photos.

<br>

I showed up early because I was a part of the workshop on healthcare and aging as that’s where my presentation was. I met a lot of awesome people with great projects for elder care including (but not limited to) some girls from Standford who rocked a program called MILES which is a lot like our smart phone program called PUCK that prompts the user to do certain things. Ours also does activity recognition. Also, a couple of women from England who filled us in on how to get your focus group attendees to be more talkative. They say offer tea and cakes, I think in America it’s coffee and bagels or donuts. And a company who makes a tablet for reminding users of things they need to do throughout the day.

<br>

Then the conference started with far too many talks to go see with many of them conflicting! But I went to every session to see something and often hopped from room to room. The opening speaker really got us off to a good start, Margaret Gould Stewart from YouTube who talked about how we share media and make it our own.

<br>

Then, off to the talks! I mostly did elder care, healthcare, or video games (simply because they’re fun). I learned a lot about video game development, for all ages, and how to design better for our older adults. I have a few pictures, but the ones that turned out well were all from the talk where they had a TV and snow globes with pictures of local area things and when you put the snow globes on the TV it played a video that helped the user to bring up old memories. It was all very interesting.

<br>

I learned other things, like that crowd sourcing your data may not be a great idea. That older adults like to play video games if they emulate things they’re used to. That video game tutorials are only necessary if it’s a complex game. And that someone made an app for your iPad that uses the camera to orient itself to the way you’re facing (but that’s not out yet). SOOOO much!

<br>

It ended with a talk by Hugh Herr from MIT who made a mechanical prothetic leg that emulates the way your ankle and knee work so that walking feels normal. It was some of the most amazing tech I saw the whole conference.

<br>

If you can’t tell in the picture (look closely) he’s wearing two of them, because he lost both of his legs in a climbing accident. It was an incredibly moving talk.

<br>

This and much much more are the reasons why CHI is my favorite conference of the year, this year AND last year. I may not be a computer scientist or engineer, but it’s great content, great parties, and I always feel welcome at this conference. If you’re in the area or are interested at all I highly recommend it.
