<p>I work in Data Science, Applied Machine Learning, or Quantitative User Experience Research. I have years of experience in statistical analysis and this has helped me a great deal when working with machine learning algorithms. Smart home projects have been some of my favorite work I've ever done, but I've recently starting working at Xbox Product Services which has brought new exciting research tasks about! </p>
<br/>
<p>Please enjoy the rest of my website and the projects that Iâ€™ve been working on.  I hope that this site can give you an idea of who I am and what I love to do.</p>
